Expand Selection to Line Before
=========================================

A command to expand the current selection to the line before, which is something I need quite often.

Each time this command runs it will expand one line above.

After expanding, you can also contract the selection back by one line.

Usage
-----

Both commands are available in the `Selection` menu and bound to the following keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Linux:

    Expand Selection by one line                Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up
    Contract by one line                        Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Down

Or similarly, on OS X:

    Expand Selection by one line                ^⌥⇧↑ (Ctrl+Option+Shift+Up)
    Contract by one line                        ^⌥⇧↓ (Ctrl+Option+Shift+Down)
